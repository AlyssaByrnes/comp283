## Problems

### Practice With Quantifiers: Coin Purses

For these problems, let:

* $$S$$ be the set of all coins I possess. It could potentially contain any coin type from any country of the world.
* $$C$$ be the set of coin purses (Coins go IN these)
* Let $$p(x)$$ be a predicate:  $$\forall x \in S$$, $$p(x)$$ is True $$\leftrightarrow x$$ is a penny. 
* Let $$e(x)$$ be a predicate:  $$\forall x \in S$$, $$e(x)$$ is True $$\leftrightarrow x$$ is a euro. 
* Let $$IN(x,c)$$ be a predicate:  $$\forall x \in S, \forall c \in C$$, $$In(x,c)$$ is True $$\leftrightarrow$$ coin $$x$$ is in coin purse $$c$$. 
* Let $$q(c)$$ be a function that returns the number of coins in coin purse $$c$$.

Express the following using predicate logic:

1. No penny is a euro.
2. There are coin purses of different sizes.
3. There is a coin purse for every coin.
4. No coin is without a coin purse. (Extra question: can there be an empty coin purse?)
5. A coin purse with a euro must contain two coins.
6. No coin purse holds both pennies and euros.

Time permitting, we will also review problems from the lessons, but I encourage you to use office hours for this as well!
