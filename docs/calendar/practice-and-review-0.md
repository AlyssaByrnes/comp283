## Problems
1. Prove $$a \leftrightarrow b \equiv (a \rightarrow b) \land (b \rightarrow a)$$ using a truth table.

2. True or False: You can prove compound propositions $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are logically equivalent by showing $$X \leftrightarrow Y$$ is a tautology. Explain your answer.
(Hint, try this for the equivalence $$p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg p \lor q$$)

3. True or False: $$((a \lor b) \oplus \neg b) \lor \texttt{True}$$ always evaluates to $$\texttt{True}$$ regardless of the values of $$a$$ and $$b$$. Explain your answer.
